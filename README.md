> **An easy user-togglable dark mode for Rocket.Chat**

This repo was migrated for ease of collaboration from [my gist](https://gist.github.com/pbaity/73beb1dd11fdc8b90e4ee032f1b3f7de) which was a fork of [**chall8909**'s gist](https://gist.github.com/chall8908/c03dd6cc443cdb9cbb7034d441a1350d), to which this project is greatly indebted.

## Overview

[**dark-mode-toggle.js**](dark-mode-toggle.js) creates and adds a click handler for a dark mode toggle button. This toggle button lives in the toolbar at the top of the left-hand sidebar:

![Toggle dark mode on with moon icon](images/button-light.png)

And when dark mode is active:

![Toggle dark mode off with sun icon](images/button-dark.png)

[**dark-mode.css**](dark-mode.css) contains the styles which - y'know, make everything dark, like so:

## Installation

**NOTE:**
- For Rocket.Chat versions 3.2.2 - 3.3.3, use the code from the [**3.2.2** branch](https://github.com/pbaity/rocketchat-dark-mode/tree/3.2.2) or from the [accompanying release](https://github.com/pbaity/rocketchat-dark-mode/releases/tag/v3.2.2).
- For 3.4.0 or newer, use the code from the **master** branch.

If you want to "install" this dark mode, here's all you need to do:

1. Be an administrator of your Rocket.Chat instance, or send these instructions to one and pester them to do it for you
2. Go to the **Administration** panel > **Layout**
3. Copy the contents of [dark-mode.css](dark-mode.css) into **Custom CSS**
4. Copy the contents of [dark-mode-toggle.js](dark-mode-toggle.js) into **Custom Scripts** > **Custom Script for Logged In Users**
5. Refresh your local Rocket.Chat instance (a server restart is _not_ required). You may need to clear your cache if using a web browser.
